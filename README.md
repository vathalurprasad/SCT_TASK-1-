# SCT_TASK-1-
# Global Population Analysis – Multi-Tool Visualization Project
# Overview
This project presents an insightful visualization and analysis of world population trends using multiple tools including Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI. The data has been sourced from the World Bank Open Data Portal, specifically focusing on the Total Population indicator.
# Project Components
File Name	Description
SCT_TASK(1).ipynb	Python notebook for data wrangling and bar chart visualizations
Papulation Analaysis TASK(1).pbix	Power BI Report focusing on India's population growth
global country analysis.pbix	Power BI dashboard comparing multiple countries globally
india_population_long.csv	Reshaped data prepared for BI use from World Bank dataset

# Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data preprocessing and static plots

Power BI for professional, interactive dashboards

World Bank Open Data as the official data source

# Key Features
# Python Visualizations:
Bar chart showing India's population from 1960 to 2024

Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas

Used Seaborn for professional styling

# Power BI Dashboards:
Dynamic slicers for year selection

Top 10 most populous countries (2024)

India’s population growth visualization

Country-wise comparisons in interactive format

# Learning Outcome
Reshaped wide-format data into long-format for visualization

Created reusable charts in Python

Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI for real-world presentation

Understood how to communicate data insights effectively using multiple tools

# How to Reuse
Run SCT_TASK(1).ipynb to generate and preview population charts.

Open .pbix files in Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboards.

Add more indicators (e.g. fertility, mortality, GDP) for deeper insights.
